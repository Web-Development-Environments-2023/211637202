    <h1>Q&A</h1>
      <p>
          As a steve harvey, i like also answering complex question that are related to the enternet,<br>
          so i am helping the student who built this web page on answering his lecturer two questions below:
          <br>
          <ol type="1">
              <li><u>Three differences between web1, web2, web3:</u><br>  
                  <ol type="a">
                      <br><li>Web1 was primarily a static web and use basic HTML, it had read only content and it didn't support mass-publishing, while Web2 and Web3 are interactive webs: Web1, also known as the "read-only" web, was a collection of static web pages that users could only read but could not interact with.</li>
                      <br><li>Web 2.0 brought about a significant change in the way users interacted with the internet by introducing social networking and collaboration features. Users could create, share, and consume content, connect with other users, and build online communities. These features were not available in Web 1.0, which mainly focused on one-way communication, and Web 3.0, which prioritizes decentralized and secure systems over social networking and collaboration.</li>
                      <br><li>Web1 and Web2 were mostly concerned with connectivity and sharing of information, and did not prioritize privacy and security. However, with growing concerns around privacy and security breaches, Web3 has been developed with a focus on providing more secure and transparent online environments for users. Web3 achieves this through the use of decentralized systems and blockchain technology, which enable greater privacy and security in online interactions.</li>
                      <br>
                  </ol>  
              </li>
              <li>
                  <u>Give a use case and explain it's differences between each web version (1-2-3):</u>
                  <br><br>use case: online education
                  <ol type="a">
                      <br><li>In Web 1.0, online education was limited to static and text-based content with little or no interaction. The courses were mostly self-paced, with no real-time feedback or support from instructors or other students. As a result, online education was not seen as a viable alternative to traditional classroom-based education.</li>
                      <br><li>In Web 2.0, online education became more interactive and collaborative with the emergence of social media platforms and video-sharing websites. This allowed for the creation of online communities where students could collaborate and learn from each other. The courses started to include multimedia content, interactive simulations, and discussion forums, and instructors could provide real-time feedback and support to students.</li>
                      <br><li>In Web 3.0, online education is expected to become even more personalized and immersive, with the use of virtual and augmented reality technologies. This will enable students to learn in realistic and interactive environments, getting hands-on experience. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable adaptive learning, where the course content and difficulty level can be customized to each student's learning style and progress. Additionally, blockchain technology will ensure secure and transparent verification of credentials, enabling students to build their professional profiles and reputation.</li>
                  </ol>  
              </li>
