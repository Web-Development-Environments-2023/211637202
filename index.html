    <h1>Q&A</h1>
      <p>
          As a steve harvey, i like also answering complex question that are related to the enternet,<br>
          so i am helping the student who built this web page on answering his lecturer two questions below:
          <br>
          <ol type="1">
              <li><u>Three differences between web1, web2, web3:</u><br>  
                  <ol type="a">
                      <br><li>Web1 was primarily a static web, while Web2 and Web3 are interactive webs: Web1, also known as the "read-only" web, was a collection of static web pages that users could only read but could not interact with. Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, is a much more interactive web, with features like social media, user-generated content, and two-way communication. Web3, the newest generation of the web, focuses on decentralization, blockchain technology, and creating a more open, transparent, and user-controlled internet.</li>
                      <br><li>Web1 was mostly text-based, while Web2 and Web3 incorporate more multimedia content: Web1 sites were mostly text-based and used limited graphics and images. With the advent of Web2, websites started incorporating more multimedia content like videos, images, and audio. Web3 takes this a step further and seeks to integrate virtual and augmented reality, making it easier for users to interact with and experience content in more immersive ways.</li>
                      <br><li>Web3 is focused on privacy and security, while Web1 and Web2 were less so: Web1 and Web2 were primarily focused on connectivity and information sharing, and privacy and security were not a primary concern. With the increasing concerns about data privacy and security breaches, Web3 is designed with an emphasis on privacy, security, and transparency. It uses decentralized systems and blockchain technology to create more secure and private online environments for users.</li>
                      <br>
                  </ol>  
              </li>
              <li>
                  <u>Give a use case and explain it's differences between each web version (1-2-3):</u>
                  <br><br>use case: online education
                  <ol type="a">
                      <br><li>In Web 1.0, online education was limited to basic online courses that mostly consisted of text-based materials, with little or no interactivity or engagement. These courses were often self-paced, with no interaction with instructors or other students. Online education was seen as a niche alternative to traditional classroom-based education.</li>
                      <br><li>In Web 2.0, online education became more interactive and engaging. The emergence of social media platforms and video-sharing websites allowed for the creation of online communities and collaborative learning environments. Online courses began to include multimedia content, interactive simulations, and discussion forums. Instructors could provide real-time feedback and support, and students could collaborate with each other in group projects.</li>
                      <br><li>In Web 3.0, online education is expected to become even more personalized, immersive, and accessible. The use of virtual and augmented reality technologies will create realistic and interactive learning environments, providing students with a hands-on learning experience. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable adaptive learning, where course content and difficulty level can be customized to each student's learning style and progress. Blockchain technology will enable secure and transparent verification of credentials and micro-credentials, enabling students to build their professional profiles and reputation.</li>
